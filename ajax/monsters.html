        <p>This continuing range of cute figurines and stationary sets are imaginative toys for kids to collect and also include limited edition sets. The current toy ranges are ribbed figurines that can be attached to multiple facets of ribbed pens, markers and brushes. Further ribbed products will also be released where the figurines can also connect to.
        </p>
        <p>The figurines designed by myself currently range across the following six thematic cues: animals and monsters, princesses, superheroes and sea creatures. Some extra ranges will also be announced and launched in 2015 as they were illustrated and designed during the same time periods.
