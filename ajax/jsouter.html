        <p>In conjuction with 3C Creative Agency, I was given the brief of building a brand new website for Julia, an experienced Counsellor and Psychotherapist working in Sydney's northern beaches. It would include her branding elements (provided by 3C Creative), an outline of her services, a price guide and also a brief guideline into psychotherapy itself.
        </p>
        <p>Julia really just wanted something very simple, attractive and inviting for her digital presence. I kept to basic design guidelines in terms of typography and grid structure and we ended up with a website which ended up pleased all parties. The responsiveness of the website also has a graceful simplicity to it. I offered to even more colour elements including a logo which would slowly wash from one color to another, but we decided that in this case minimalism should win out.
