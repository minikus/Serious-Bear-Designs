        <div class="cbp-l-inline-desc">
        <p>It was built in conjunction with SansSerif Design Sydney, who provided the branding, imagery and basic design. As per their logo, name and produce, the client needed an online presence which would reflect something new, clean fresh and exciting. I wanted the website to be modern and tidy, with an uncomplicated structure and an easy but attractive interface to draw new customers in.
        </p>
        <p>For this project we used a responsive theme and constructed the many given elements on top of it, making sure to display every product clearly and treating the typography so that the design would look great scaled all the way down to mobile-device sizes. We believe it is a nice combination of an online environment which is very modern, but also still quite organic.
