        <div class="cbp-l-inline-desc">
        <p>The channel ReelTV would be aimed at teenagers and young adults and two of the main features of the channel would be a winter sport program, and a sci-fi program. We approached this project by creating illustrative designs in photoshop and then importing them into a website skin I previously mocked up. I wanted simply to create eye catching comic-like visuals which would appeal to the age group. I took it as a challenge to myself to create these elements either from scratch or by modifying the photographs themselves to the extent that they are almost unrecognisable. It was chance to get away for a little while from the more serious principles of graphic design and have some fun.
