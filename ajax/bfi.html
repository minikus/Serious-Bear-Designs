        <p>Science fiction film is a genre that uses speculative, science-based depictions of imaginary phenomena such as extra-terrestrial lifeforms, alien worlds, and time travel, often along with technological elements such as futuristic spacecraft, robots, or other technologies. Science fiction films have often been used to provide social commentary on political or social issues, and to explore philosophical issues, such as the human condition. This brief's assignment to create a film guide for the British Film Institute Sci-Fi Film Festival. The event will present some of the finest works of Science Fiction Film-making over the past half-century.

	        The main object of this assignment was to create a dramatic cover art and layout which will draw the customer in. I decided to use Photoshop as the first medium to create the images and then importing them into Indesign, where the layout, typography and organisation of elements were arranged. I wanted to promote a more thoughtful tone to the brief because many of the best films of the genre often skate along the edge of philosophy, physics and the future of humankind while mixing in a sense of adventure and wonder. The other challenge was to create a fold-out design which adapted to each page opening of the double-gate fold format while displaying a full poster image on expansion.
