        <p>This would be Taster's first foray into web development and it was decided that the best way to market the new app would be online through Electronic Direct Mail. The EDM would include details and functions of the new app, download instructions as well as one free recipe contained in the second half the page.

	        This was my first venture at designing an EDM and the condensed presentation and structure of the format was the first challenge. Creating thoughtful spacing and form for the content which was frequent in well presented cookbooks was very important, and after that designing a textured, but inconspicuous background were the essential ingredients. Overall it was a great experience and I would like to create more EDMs in the future. Designed mostly in photoshop, including the mocks.
