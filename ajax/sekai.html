        <p>Mocca Design Australia asked me to create a website for their off-shoot design company called Studio Sekai, which would be more often aimed at higher-end clientele and businesses. They wanted to present some of their leading designs and best selling products to present an option of creating client work which might take a little more effort to invent and shape, but would be of the best standard they could possibly offer without the usual constraints of time and budget.

	        I was given a design theme to work from and materials such as logos, colours and basic imagery and I started the build from there. Some of the effects were a little more difficult to implement, but I think the end result was a stylish digital experience aimed at exactly the right demographics.
