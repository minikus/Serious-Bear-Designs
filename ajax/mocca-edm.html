        <p>As part of their continuing online marketing campaign, Mocca Design asked me to design and build an email to send out to attract new clients and refresh old ones. As I was currently managing and re-writing the copy for their website (built through Wordpress), it was a matter of taking the elements, colours and the design style from their current website and incorporating it into the new EDM.
        </p>
        <p>The most important elements of the EDM would be that is responsive- as Mocca itself was trying to grow as a design studio which provides greta web services, that it is colourful but simple in it's design, and that it links effectively to each landing page built within the Mocca Design website.
